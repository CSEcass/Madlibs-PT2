        <p>Madlibs is an old game which can be compared to a, "Fill in the blank" type of game. 
            <br>
            The main function of the game is to fill in a form which commonly consist of nouns, 
            <br>
            adverbs, adjectives, and other word types for you to input into each box. Afterwards 
            <br>
            when you are done submitting your answers, those same answers will be used to fill 
            <br>
            in the blanks of a themed paragraph. It's usually played at parties or amny sort of 
            <br>
            events with multiple people.
